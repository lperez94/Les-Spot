    <p>Are you looking for me? </p>
    <p>Why? I barely know you. Did you at least visit my <a href="resume.html">about </a>page?</p>
    <p>You did? Okay! </p>
    <p>If you want to get in contact with me. It will be just as difficult as finding Klaus in the second season of the Vampire Diaries. </p>
    <p>You didn't watch the show? Well you need to. It serious a good show. (I haven't watched it in years. This is highschool Leslie's opinion.)</p>
    <p>Okay to find me you must...</p>
    <p>Ask a friend to ask another friend...</p>
    <p>To contact a family member who will..</p>
    <p>Contact another friend to find a witch...</p>
    <p>THEN once you have the witch do a tracker spell.</p>
    <p>And finally you will have contacted me!</p>
    <p>HA. I am kidding. </p>
    <p><a href="mailto:lperez94@unm.edu">Here is my email. </a></p>
    <p>If you also would like:</p>
    <p>My Cell Number #127. I've been locked up in the NCT jail for a minute now. Wrongfully convicted. :(</p>
    <p>Or if you would like to talk over the phone..</p>
    <p>(127) 330-8138. Send me a text before you call though. </p>
