    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>Growing up my family would be continuously moving so I have had my fair share of schools in my 21 years of life.</p>
    <p>I will say I was the only one of my parent's four children who attended preschool. Stating that, I'm not saying I'm smarter than my siblings... but... </p>
    <p>The preschool I attended was in a quiet neighborhood in Rio Rancho. There I learned the most essential skill I have today. </p>
    <p>How to speak English. </p>
    <p>My parents put me in the most terrifying anxiety inducing experience any bilingual kid could ever experience. Thankfully I survived. </p>
    <p>The rest of my early education also takes place in Rio Rancho. Up until going to college. Which is how I am here. </p>
    <p>I am the only child so far to attend college. Once again, I am not saying I am the smartest but... I will be until my younger siblings catch up. </p>
    <p>As of right now, I am in my junior year of college, studying Strategic Communications with a minor in Arts Leadership and Business. </p>
    <p>I am not entirely sure if I would want to go to graduate school but it is a tempting offer to hide from the real world for another 4 years. </p>
