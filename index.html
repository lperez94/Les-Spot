    <p>Hello! Welcome to my spot! </p>
    <p>Here you'll be able to read up about me! Is that your favorite topic? </p>
    <p>No? Well too bad! You are already here! And I welcome you with a big warm hug as one of my favorite icons would say. </p>

    <p>If you go to my <a href="funfacts.html">fun facts</a> page, I will let you in on one of my frozen secrets!</p>
    <p>Let me properly introduce myself. </p>
    <p>Hi, my name is Leslie. I am creating this webpage as a final project for my communications web design class. Starting off I was not entirely sure if I would enjoy the class. To be completely honest I had some beef with the course mainly due to the fact that my century-old windows computer ran so SLOW. It being so slow resulted in some missed assignments, which I sincerely apologize about. Now that I have a better computer I am really enjoying the class. Which is so sad because it's over :'( . I will miss being a tech girlie. </p>

    <p>I'll include this image so you can put a face to all the information you will be browsing. This was me after the first time I went to Universal Studios in August. Best time of my life. </p>
    <p>Okay, I will cut this page short because I gotta save some information for the other pages! </p>
